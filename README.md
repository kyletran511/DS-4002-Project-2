# DS4002 Project 2: Anomaly Detection of Parking Ticket Issuance in Charlottesville Between 1999 and 2025

## Overview:
This project aims to perform an anomaly detectection on a parking ticket dataset issued by the City of Charlottesville between the years 1999 and 2025 in order to identify factors that influence the frequency of parking tickets issued at a given time. 

## Software and Platform Used
Python was used for data processing, analysis, and visualization.
some of the packages we used: 
- pandas â€“ For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- matplotlib & seaborn â€“ For data visualization.
- Isolation Forest (from scikit-learn) â€“ For anomaly detection
- ttest_ind - For statistical analysis (Mann Whitney U test)

The platform used for development was Google Colab via a juptyer notebook
